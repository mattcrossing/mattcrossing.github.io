            <p>

                Welcome to xMattify's game review and blogs (The name is temporary. I'm working on a cooler name =D ). 
                <br>
                This is my official website. Here I plan on posting reviews, facts and other stuff about my favourite games. I've been a big Nintendo fan
                <br> for many years, so expect most of the content you see on here to reflect my appreciation for the games Nintendo has developed.
                <br>
                I don't currently have a lot of time to work on this site, combined with the fact that my HTML skills are nothing to brag about, so you
                should expect development on this site to progress at a rather slow pace. 
                <br>
                That being said, make sure to bookmark this page if you're interested in what's to come in the future, and be sure to check back every now and then
                to see what's changed.

                Anyway, that's about enough waffle from me, so I will leave you with a link to my YouTube channel here where you can check out some of my content while you wait
                for this site to no longer be a white page with a giant slab of text on it.
